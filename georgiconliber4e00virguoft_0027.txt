ΤΟ VIRGIL.

WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE MANTUANS FOR THE
NINETEENTH CENTENARY OF VIRG1L⁷S DEATU.

1.

Roman Virgil, thou that singest

Ilion’s lof‘oy temples robed in sire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising,

wars, and filial faith, and Dido's pyre;

11.

Landsoape·lover‚ lord of language

more than he that sang the VVorks and Days,
All the chosen coin of fancy

fiashing out from many a golden phrase;

111.

Thou that singest wheat and woodland,
tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd ς,

All the oharm of all the Muses
often flowering in a lonely word 3

IV.

Poefi of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers3
Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the laughing shepherd bound with flowers 3

V,

chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again ‘co be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea ς,
