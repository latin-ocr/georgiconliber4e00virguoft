68 VERG. GEORG. IV.

387-414. ‘ Yon must capture Proleus, who seeds the herde of
Neptune, ancl is α seer, but when captured keep him tiyhtly
bound in spice of all his deviccs to escape and compel him to
replis. I will lead you ιο α spot on the shore where he take-3 his
midday rest, and when you hae-e caatyhl hz'm he will turn into
all manner of shapes to elude you, but the more he does so che
more closely you must hold him ’.

The whole passage about Proteus is copied from Od. 4.
382 seq. ‚ where Menelaus takes him prisoner by the advice of

Eidothea.

387. carpathio] The Carpathian sea lies between Rhodes
and Crete, near the island Carpathus.

388. magnum...] ‘who traverses the mighty deep with
fishes and a yoked team of two-footed steeds'. The steeds
of Proteus are at once ‘fishes and two-footed horses’, the
ἱππόκαμποι, creatures in shape like a ‘ sea-horse '‚ which sea-

G. 3. 91 M artis equi biiuges et maynz currus Achilli.

stantival sentence=rcz ἕοντα, but they may equally well be
oblique question dependent on novit repeated.

393. trahantur] expresses the sequence or connection of
events, and suggests the threads of destiny.

394. quippe...] ‘for surely such is the will of Neptune ’.
Both quippe and visum esc are stately.

397. expediat] ‘make clear '. eventusque secundet: ‘give
prosperous issue '.

398. nam sine vi] Nam explains the emphatic vinclis of
396, the assonance in vinclis and vi assisting this and the re-
petition (as usual in inverted order) of vim and vincula in 399
making it still elearer, ‘with fetters must he be secured for
