chamber in the depths of the river'; the chamber is de-
scribed as a grotto 'm 373. For the position of sub cf. Ecl. 8.

334. Milesia vellera] i.e. the choicest wool, cf. G. 3. 307
M ilesia magmo Ι vellera mutentur.

335. carpebant] Cf. line 390 n. hyali ‘dyed with a
rich sea-green hue ’. ὕαλος (see L. and S.) is probably ‘glass'
and the sea-nymphs wear garments of the colour of glass or
of the sea, cf. vitreis sedilibus 350, where vitreus = ὑάλινος.

336. Drymoque ...] The names are all Greek, but some of
them describe wood—nymphs; both classes of nymphs being
regarded as ‘ sisters' (cf. 382). Drymo is from δρυμός,
‘ an oak-coppice ' ; Xantho from ξανθὸς, ‘ golden-haired ⁷ ;
Liqca from λίγεια, ‘clear-voiced'; Phyllodoce apparently:
‘ leaf-receiving ², cf. Cymodoce, ‘ wave-receiving' ; Nesaee from
νῆσος; &pio from σπεῖοςῑσπέος, ‘a cavern'; Thalia from
θάλλω z ‘ blooming ' ; C'ydz'ppe from κῦδος and ἵππος, ‘ exulting
in horses'3 Lycorias (?) from λύκος; Clio from κλείω, ‘to
cplegrate in song '3 Deiopea, (ἲ) ‘she of the martial voice',
c . alliope.

337. caesariem...] ‘with glossy ringlets streaming over
their snowy necks’. caesariem is probably direct acc. after
effusae used in a middle sense ‘having their looks floating',
ef. 357 percussa mentem ‘having her soul smitten’3 371
auratus cornua ‘having his horns gilded'; 482 caeruleos
inplexae crinibus annues ‘having snakes entwined in their
hair ⁷. Others call these accusatives of respect, cf. 181.

338. Nesaee] The line is inserted from Aen. 5. 826 and copied
from Il. 18. 39 Θάλειά τε Κυμοδόκη τε ᾗ Νησαίη Σπείω τε, but· is
prrgrblapllgrmggrious, as the remainder of Virgil’s list differs

bigni& Lucinae...] ‘ having experienced the travail of child-

341. Oceanitides] Ὠκεανίτιδεςε only here in Latin.

342. ambae] ‘both with gold, both girdled with dappled
skins’. They are marked as huntresses, cf. Aen. 1. 323
succincam pharetra et maculosae tegymine lyncis. auro probably
only goes loosely with incinctae, Virgil meaning little more
than that they wore golden ornaments, not necessarily a
golden girdle.
