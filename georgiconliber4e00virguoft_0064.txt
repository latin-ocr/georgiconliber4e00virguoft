with indic. is fairly common. hos: masc. because he thinks
of them as soldiers and not as bees ; so qnisquam 107.

86, 87. The humour of these lines is obvious, the heroic
description of battle which precedes being in ludicrous con-
trast with the simple expedient by which the combat is ended.
Editors however ignore the pathos which seems to be latent in
Virgil’s words when read as a reflection on the vanity of human
ambition-all passions and rivalries are laid to rest for ever
‘ with the flinging of a little (lust '. Possibly Virgil did not
intend this, and yet the words pulveris iaetu might certainly
suggest burial to a Roman ear, cf. Hor. Od. l. 28. :35lz'ceb17c Ι
iniecto ter pulvere curras, On the other hand Varro, who
recommends flinging dust on a swarm to make them settle,
uses exactly the same words—iaez'nndo in eas· pidverem—with
no secondary meaning, and so Pliny ll. 18 dimicatio iniectu
pulveris aucfumo tota discutitur.

88-102. After the combat. Icill the worse-leoffius] of the two
kinqs: the better one will be brisslct and brilliant, the other dark-
Zookinq, rougyh, and fat-paunched. So too with the common bees .·
they will be like their leaders, and it is only the better sort which
will form a qood stock and yield homey at once abundant and
well-flavoured.

89. ne prodigus ...] ‘him‚ lest his wastefulness bring ruin,
deliver to execution' : for prodique, cf. the description in 94;
he eats and does no work. Clearly Virgil intends this pre-
cept about killing the king to apply to his followers also, who
are described as exactly like him, and who, it is implied from
loo-102, will be a worthless stock and produce no honey.

90. vacua: i.e. without a rival. sine regnet: ‘let him
reign ’.

91. alter ...] The sentence is interrupted; instead of going
on with a second alter Virgil breaks off with an explanation,
which is intended to show why you will be sure to find one of
the two kings ‘worse-looking' (deterior qni visus) than the
other, the fact being that there are two ‘ breeds’ (qenera) and
a king of the better breed is easily ‘distinguished (insigynis)
both by shape (ore) and the brilliancy of his ruddy scales ⁷.
⁴ Virgil has here aecurately described the two commonest forms
