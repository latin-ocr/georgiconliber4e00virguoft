32 VERG. GEORG. IV

Gora-sco: ‘ shake’, ‘make to vibrate ’‚ is constantly used in-
transitivcly z ‘ flash ’‚ ‘ gleain’ of the light which any bright
body in inovenient gives off ε both it and coruscus· are especially
used in connection with armour and military weapons ; hence
the ehoice of it here.

74. spiculaque exacuunt rostris] Two renderings are given
(1) ⁶ sharpen their stings with their beaks’, (2) ‘ sharpen the
stings to ⁷ or ‘for their beaks ’.

(1) As the sting of a bee is in its tail the action seems
impossible. It has, however, been suggested that a bee’s
action in cleaning itself, when it first scrapes the abdomen
with its legs and then removes the dirt from the legs with
its mandibles (rostris), has been mistaken for a process of
sharpening the tip of the tail or the sting which it contains.

(2) Though the head of a bee is only furnished with man-
dibles and a proboscis for collecting honey, yet it is quite
possible that Virgil considered it to be actually armed with
some weapon of offence which he compares to a ‘dart'
(spiculum). On the other hand spicula in 237 is certainly
: ‘ stino‘s ².

Rosffis will suit either interpretation, for rostrum (from
rodo, ‘ the gnawing‘ or ‘biting thing’) may describe either
the whole ⁴ head ' of an animal, or the special part with which
it bites, gnaws‚ ete. = ‘mandibles ⁷, ‘ bill '‚ ‘ beak ', etc.

75. praetoria] Of. Shakespeare’s ‘the tent-royal of their
emperor '‚ line 153 n.

76. miscentur] ‘crowd,’ ‘throng’,

77. ergo] ‘theref0re‚' i.e. as the natural result of all these
warlike preparations. ver sudum ε ‘ a clear' or ‘ fine spring
day ’; bees never venture out in rain. camposque patentes ε
the ‘ open field’ is the clear sky.

78. concurritur] For intransitive verbs used iinpersonally
in the passive, cf. 189 silem}- : 375 perventum est. aethere in
alto: Bees <lo grapple with one another in the air, but the
actual struggle takes place on the ground. ‘When two
bees are struggling in this manner they descend to the
ground, for in the air they would not be able to get purchase
enough to be sure of striking each other. They then engage
in a hand-to-hand fight They are continually making
stabs with their stings ³ (Figuier).
