NOTES. 55

260. tractimque...] ‘and there is a long-drawn buzzing’.
Τνασιίφη, lit. ‘with drawing out', ‘in drawling fashion'3
cf. cursim ‘with running’‚ ‘ hurriedly'3 pedetemptim, ‘with
feeling the way‚’ ‘cautiously ³, etc.

261. ut quondam] ‘as often ², ‘as at ti1nes'3 quondam is
used in introducing a comparison with something which
happens frequently; cf. G. 3. 99 ut quondam in stipulis
iqnz‘s Ι incassum furit. inmurmurat: ⁶ rustles amidst'. For
the south wind as cold cf. G. 3. 279. The three comparisons
are adapted from Il. 14. 394 seq.

262. ut ...] ‘ as the fretful sea, when the surge flows back ³.
Scridic describes a hard sibilant sound heard when a wave
has broken and falls back3 cf. Tennyson’s “I heard the
shingle grinding in the surge’'. For the form stridEre cf.
556 n.

263. aestuat] ⁶ seethes ’ς as in the previous two comparisons
ghgeasscggldngiliggested is sibilant—such as you often hear from

264. galbaneos ...] Galbanum was also used (G. 3. 415) to
get rid of snakes by its strong smell (nidor) when burned.
suadebo: ‘I shall advise'‚ i.e. when such a case occurs to
you3 cf. proderit 267. The use of the future seems quite
distinct from that of the didactic ‘ thou shalt' with the 2nd
person, for which see mittes 545, mactabis, revises 546.

265. ultro] i.e. do not wait for the bees to show any desire
for food, but go further, and urge them to take it ; ef. 204 n.

f 266. fessas] i.e. sick, cf. Hor. C. S. 63 qui salutari levat arte
essos.

267. tunsum gallae saporem] ‘ the pounded oak-gall's
flavour '. A good instance of what is called Hypallage
(transference of epithet) ; cf. Aen. 8. 526 Tyrrhenusque tubae
clanyor ‘ the Tyrrhene trumpet's bray ἐ in all such cases the
phrase must be closely knit together. Oak-galls are an
astringent, and bees suffer much from dysentery.

268. igni...] ‘wine-syrup (made) rich with much boiling’‚
i.e. by evaporating much of the water, cf. G. l. ⁶295.

269. Psithia...] From G. 2. 93 (et passo Psithia. utilior)
it is clear that Virgil refers to passum, wine made from dried
grapes, and not to actual dried grapes.
