60 VERG. GEORG. IV.

310. trunca. pedum] Cf. Lucr. 5. 840 orba, pedum. stri-
dentia. pennis: ‘whirring with wings’; cf. Aen. 1. 397
stridentibus alis.

311. miscentur...] ‘swarm, and ever more and more try
the thin air '. carpo is very common in the poets with such
words as viam, iter, etc, in the sense of ‘ seize on ’‚ = ‘ take a
journey' or ‘road’, and some render here ‘ soar through'
(cf. G. 3. 142 carpere prata fuya), but it seems rather to de-
scribe the first ineffectual efforts of the insects, whose wings
are yet but half-developed, to fly. They keep trying to get
hold of the air. magis magis: cf. Cat. 64. 274 mayz's maqis
increbrescunc; Eur. lph. T. 1406 μᾶλλον μᾶλλον.

312. ut effusus...] So Aen. 8. 317 effic-si nimbo similes, of
runners starting in a race. Tennyson has a similar but finer
irnage—“ Like summer tempest came her tears ''.

313. erupere] The instantaneous perfect (cf. 330 n.)‚ the
sudden outburst of the fully developed swarm being con-
trasted with the previous gradual development. pulsante:
probably intr. (cf. G. 3. 106 pavor pulsans)= ‘twanging'.
Others say ‘supply eam ⁷, but pulsare sayittam is doubtful
Latin.

314. prima...] ‘ whenever the light Parthians first begin
the combat’. Ancient combats often commenced with a
discharge of arrows before the armies came to close quarters,
but the Parthians were also especially famous for their use
of the bow in fighting, their mounted archers harassing the foe
from a distance, and continually retreating when attacked,
pouring in showers of arrows as they did so (cf. G. 3. 31
fidentemque ,ἴημα Parthum versisque sayitcis). leves: sug-
gests a contrast between their light cavalry and the heavy-
armed Roman infantry.

315-558. According to Servius the whole of this portion
of the book was originally an encomium on the poet C.
Cornelius Gallus, for which the present story was sub-
stituted after his disgrace and death. He was a writer of
elegiacs and a friend of Virgil (see Eel. x.), but, though he
fought on the side of Octavian at Actium, and was made by
him prefect of Egypt, he there incurred the displeasure of
the Emperor, and committed suicide 13.c. 26.
