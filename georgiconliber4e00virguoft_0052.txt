1. protinus] Mai-ks this book as a continuat-ion of the
preceding ones. After dealing with (1) the culture of the
fields in Bk. 1.‚ (2) the management of trees in Bk. 11.‚ and
(3) the care of cattle in Bk. 111., he now comes to the last
division (partem) of his subject, and asks for it too (etiam) the
favour of Maecenas, as he had already asked it for the three
former divisions.

aerii, caelestia: The ancients believed that honey fell in
the form of dew from heaven. The belief arises from the
existence of honey-dew. a glutinous saccharine substance
which in sultry weather is found covering the leaves of many
trees, especially oaks, elms, and limes, and is eagerly con-
sumed by bees. It is generally regarded as an exudation of

which live upon the leaves. The abundance of this ‘ heavenly
gift’ will, according to Virgss, mark the return of the golden
age (Ecl. 4. 30), as the close of it was marked by its with—
drawal, cf. G. l. 131 mellaque decussit foliis.

3. admiranda ...] This line gives the key—note to the whole
book. It is in making ‘little things' into a ‘marvellous
spectacle ' that Virgil displays throughout his utmost skill.
The opening words of the next line illustrate how this will
be done, viz. by speaking of bees as if they were human
beingS, animated with human interests, and governed by all
the laws of human society. For the antithesis of admiranda
levium, cf. G. 3. *290 anqustis hunc addere rebus honorem, and
in an opposite manner Hor. Od. 13. 3. 72 conamur tenues

yraudia.
