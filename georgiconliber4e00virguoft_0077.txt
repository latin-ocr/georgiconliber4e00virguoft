NOTES. 47

Both Virgil (Ecl. 10. 39 et nimae violae sunt et vaccinia niqra)
and Theocritus (10. 28 καὶ τὸ ἴον μέλαν ἕντι, καὶ ἀ ’γραπτὰ
ὑάκινθος) call it ‘black ³, while in Ecl. 3. 63 it is suave rubens
hyacinthus. and Ovid calls it: Tyrio nitentionostro. Hence
Martyn identifies it with the ‘Martagon⁷ lily, which is
of a deep blood eolour with curious markings on the petals
(see illustration in his edition).

187. tum corpora. curant] A regular phrase: ‘refresh
themselves'; cf. Aen. 3. 511. It includes not merely eating
but bathing, etc.

188. mussantque ...] Notice this beautiful phrase descrip-
tive equally of the bees and of an evening gossip on the
doorstep. Aristotle says that when they return in an evening
θορυβοῦσι τὸ πρῶτον until the signal is given for repose (ἕως ἂν
μιά περιπετομένη βοηθήσῃ, ὥσπερ σημαίνουσα καθεύδειν “ εἶτα
ἐξαπίνης σιωπῶσιν), and so Pliny, N. H. 11. 10.

189. siletur...] ‘ there is silence into the night ’, ‘ silence is
prolonged into the night ³.

190. suus] ‘their own slumber', ‘well-won slumber ’. The
word refers to artus (cf. 22 11.) z the ‘ weary limbs' have
‘ earned a night's repose,' it is theirs, they need it.

191-196. When rain or wind threaten& they do not venture
οη any buc brief fliahts, sometimes carrying) wilh them Ciny
stone-s as ballast.

193. circum] i.e. close around the hive. tutae, sub moenibus,
aquantur, and eme-ursus (‘sa11ies ⁹) all suggest the idea of
soldiers in a beleaguered town.

194. et saepe ...] ‘and often, as unstable barks on tossing
waves (take) ballast, they upheave tiny stones ⁷. Perhaps
there is some reference to the mason-bee. Note the sense of
effort indicated by the spondaic tollunt- followed by a pause.

197-209. Bees do not marry or produce offisprinsl, but the
females [Jather their young] from flowers, and clius supply the
hive with α Ιεὶηῃ awl tiny citizens, while they continually renew
his palace and wax-{mist realm, often los-inq their lives in
their devotion to brinssiny home stores of homey. Therefore
(i.e. in consequence of this (lerolton in thus continually renewiny
the rare and malm), cho‘zcslh each bee's life is brief, tlte racc
‘remotius imperishable.
