131. verbenas] An unknown herb 01· shrub specially used
in sacred rites (Eoi. S. 652 Hor. Od. l. 19. 14; Liv. l. 24).
premens: ‘planting'3 cf.G. 2. 346. vescum: This curious word
certainly means ‘ small ; ’ of. Ov. Fast. 3. 446 vescaque parva
vocant ,· Pliny N. H. 7. 81 corpore vesco sed eximiis viribus ,-
1111001326 vesco eale sacra peresa, ‘fine spray '3 (23175

Servius says vescum qno iescimur zeferiiug to the fact that
seeds of the white poppy were made into a dish with honey
for dessert, but this, like the view of Gellius (16. 5. 6), that
it is from ve-esca ε ‘eating muoh' or ‘eating little’ seems
merely an attempt to find an etymology for an obscure word.

132. regum ...] ‘ matched the wealth of kings by his spirit ’‚
Conington. He was poor, but by his pluck managed to live
like a primm, the produce of his toil enabling him to ‘ buz-den

but when you say ‘first to pluek⁷ you make clear in what

violas tondere manu) blossoms of the soft hyacinth.' comam:
the whole growth, including both flowers and leaves ; cf. Col.
10. 277 tellurisque comam. For the ‘hyaeinth'‚ cf. 183 n.
For the scansion tondebat hyacinthi, of. 453 n. Virgil has
hyacinthus five times at the end of a line, hymenaei ten times,
and so too czzpaiisms, elephanto, terebintho.

138. aestatem] ‘taunting summer for its lateness aud the
zephyrs for their delay'3 seram and morantes are predioativ e.
The Romans grew roses and 111105 111 greenhouses (Mart. 4. 22.
