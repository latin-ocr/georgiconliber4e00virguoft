54 VERG. GEORG. IV.

249. incumbent ...] ‘ will press on to repair the ruins of their
fallen race ³. lta-umbem, exactly like our ‘ put their shoulder
to the wheel to ’ ; for inf. after it cf. line 10 n.

250. foros] (1) The gangway of a ship; (2) a row of seats
in a theatro, and so here a row of cells. fioribus = anything
got from flowers (cf. 38), here clearly wax (not ‘pollen',
as Conington gives).

251-270. I f your bees sichen—and you will detect it at, once by
changye oscolour and appearance, thefrequemy ofdeaths, qeneral
inactivuy, and α dulc buzzinq—tlzen you must burn {salbanum
and tempe them withhoney miaeed with θεαί-παῦε, wine-syrup, etc.

251. casus nostros] i.e. human ills. The extremely rare
rhythm apibus Ι quoque (cf. G. 1. 80) 5661115 to throw a melancholy
emphasis on apibus. The apodosis to si Zansluebmzt is 1. 264
hic iam suadebo, but in 254-263 Virgil interrupts the con-
struction with a list of symptoms.

253. quod iam ...] ‘ which when it happens ² ; so below 264
hic iam ‘ then when this happens ’.

254. continuo est aegris] continuo goes with aeyris, ‘as
soon as they begin to sicken they change colour’; then
follows a ‘ragged leanness of aspect ’ ; then death. For this
force of continuo, cf. G. 1. 169 continuo in silvi& 356 continuo
ventis sumentibus ‘as soon as the winds begin to rise’.
horrida describes the rough, ragged look of the hair on
their bodies3 cf. Varro 3. 16 minus valentium sigma, si sun(
pilosae et horridae.

L ²255.41u3c5e carentum] a stately phrase for -the dead, found in
ucr. . .

257. aut illae] ‘or else observe'. This pleonastic use of
ille to draw marked attention to the subject is common, cf.
128; G. 3. 2173 501 incertam ibidem Ι sudor, et ille quidem
morituris fi⁴issidzos‚ ‘an intermittent sweat anch observe, at the
approach of death cold ⁹. pedibus : ‘ they hang twinecl in a
cluster by their feet’3 cf. Aen. 7. 66 pedibus per mutua
nexis pependit (of a swarm). Some give ‘with their feet
‘lrawn up '; but, if so, what force has pendent ⁸?

259. contracto] ‘ pinched ²: the adj. is applied to cold itself
though it strictly describes its effect.
