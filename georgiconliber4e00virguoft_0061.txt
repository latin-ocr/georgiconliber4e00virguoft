N OTES. 31

67. sin autem ...] With elaborate art Virgil gives his lan—
guage here the appearance of careless ease. He begins ‘but if
they have gone forth to battle '‚ then breaks off with a descrip-
tion (nam... hostem 76) of the cause of such frays and the
preparation for them, gives an account of the battle itself 77·85‚
and finally 86, 87, tenders that advice to the bee-keeper which
the opening words sin excierint lead us to expect, and which
is the nominal reason for the whole paragraph. Some say
that the irregularity of the construction reproduces ‘ the
enthusiasm with which the poet throws himself into the
subject ' (Forbiger), or ‘ the tumultuous emotions of the bees ²
(Denticke)‚ but there is nothing strongly passionate in the
passage, which is rather highly artistic.

69. trepidantia bello] ‘trembling (i.e. with eager excite-
ment) for the fray’; for the dat. cf. Aen. 7. 482 belloque
animos accendit=in bellum. Others give ‘with war ', ‘with
warlike ardour ³.

70. namque .‚.] ‘ for the well-known martial note of harsh-
sounding brass urges on the laggards ' ; what the note is (viz.
that of the trumpet) is immediately explained in the next clause.

Varro (3, 16) also alludes to a trumpet-like sound made by
the ‘ kings' (duces), and it is known that in a hive where there
are several unliberated young queens the actual queen is
always trying to kil} them in their cells, and is prevented by
the workers—‘ Ι saw her hasten to the other royal cell and
attempt to tear it open ..., but the workers pulled her violently
back. At every repulse she emitted the shrill monotonous
petes), peep, peep, so well known to hee-masters, while the
unhatched queen emitted the same kind of sound, but in a
hoarser tone, the consequence of her eonfined situation.’
(Naturalist's Library, Vol. 5. Edin. 1843.) This pipinq
sound of the actual queen to which the young queens respond
‘in a voice sounding hoarse from the recesses of their prison ’
is constantly heard just before swarming. which is also a
period of great agitation in the hive, so that virgil seems
writing here from genuine observation.

72. fractos ...] Cf. the well-known line of Ennius, at tuba
terribili sonitu tarantara dimit.

73. trepidae...] ‘eagerly they throng together with flash-
ing pinions '. Notice that incer se coeunt is not ⁴ join battl&t
