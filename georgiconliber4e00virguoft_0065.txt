or varieties of Apis mellifica, viz. A. ‘mellifica var. [fanatica
(the Ligurian bee) and A. mellg'fica. The Ligurian bee is dis-
tinguished by bright brown spots on the three first segments
of the abdomen ; it is a stronger, inore vigorous and glossy
form than the other, which is more hairy and duller in
appearance. Although gentler under human manipulation
the Ligurian bee is much fiercer in resisting foes and would
certainly defeat the other variety in battle. In a combat

between bees of the same variety the difference Vix-gil describes
would not be seen ’. (Ο. H. L.)

maculis auro squalentibus ardens is exactly z rutilis clarus
squamis, for Virgil undoubtedly connects squaleo with squama,
cf. Aen. 10. 314 tunicam squalentem auro, aud 9. 707 duplici
squama lorica fidelis ct auro, which both describe armour
made of gold plates overlaid like scales, The phrase describes
the bee as if he were an arined chief—‘ ablaze with inarkings
of golden mail ’.

The adj. is perpetually used to express the effect of neglect
(cf. desidia here) on persons or things.

from deep dust (i.e. a road deep in dust) and spits the dirt
from his parched mouth ⁷. Columella (9. 10) quoting this
passage, writes deterior sordido sputo (‘ spittle ³) similis, tam
foedus quam puluere ἰ’ἱαῐον, and so makes Virgil compare
the bee to the actual spittle of a dusty traveller. Such a
coarse comparison seems however precluded‚ not merely as a
matter of taste, but because it is the condition of the traveller
himself which is the main subject of the sentence, the fact of
his spitting being introduced incidentally to illustrate that
condition. Moreover, throughout, the bees are compared to
men and not to things, while the words turpes horrens, which
Virgil applies to these bees, are far inore applicable to nien
who have been plodding through dust and dirt than to
spittle.
