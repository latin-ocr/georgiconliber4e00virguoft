74 VERG. GEORG. IV.

repetition of the wail. So too 466 te veniente die, te decedente
canebat expresses melancholy iteration of the same theme,
while 509 flevisse et yelidis llaec evolvisse sub antri& Ι ‘mul-
centem {iure-5, ec assentem carmine quercus the double rhyme is
too marked to be accidental. Then compare Hor. Ep. 1. 14. 7
⁸fratrem maerentis rapto de fratre dolemus, and Ep. 2. 2. 79
tu me inter strepitus nocturnos atque diurnos, and consider
whether two poets with such wonderful ear for sound as
Horace and Virgil would introduce these lines into their
most finished poenis without design.

Rhodopeia} arces ε Virgil sometimes shortens a long vowel
or diphthong (when not in arsis) before a word beginning
with a vowel, the practice being borrowed from Homer, e.g.
Od51. 27 Ὀλυμπίοῦ ἀθρόοῖ ἢσανε cf. Aen. 3. 211 insulae Ionio;
5. 261 Ili& alto.

462. Rhesi i.e. Thrace, of which Rhesus was king,
cf. Hor. Od. 2. 16. 5 bello furiosa Thrace.

463. Actias Orithyia. Orithyia was a daughter of Erectheus,
king of Attica (hence called Actias from Ἀκτὴ or Ἀκταία, an
old name of Attica = ‘the peninsula’), who was carried off
by Boreas to Thrace.

465. Note the pathos of te four times repeated, the asson-
ance of solo secum, and the weary iteration of veniente and

decedente.

467. Taenarias fauces] Somewhere in the rocky promontory
of Taenarum at the S. of Laconia was a cave fabled to lead
into the lower world.

468. et caligantem ...] ‘ a grove murky with black terror ’.
Groves were always regarded by early peoples with awe as
the abodes of spirits ; hence Virgil makes frequent mention
of them in connection with hell and its approaches ; cf. Aen.
6. 131, 154, etc. Note the weight of the line.

470. nesciaque ...] The ἀμείλιχος Ἀΐδης of Il. 9. 154 3 cf. Hor.
Od. 2. 14. 6 inlacrimabilem Plutonem for the inf„ cf. 134 n.

471-503. As he sang] there thronyed around him the comelless
yhosts and phantom-s of the (lead, while hell itselswas amazed.
But on his return, justas he reached the apper air, forgsefflcl
of Proserpina's command, he looked back upon his wzjfe. Thcn
all was wadone ,· hell shook, and with a last cry ofreproach and
