It is well known that two queens cannot exist together in
a hive. If a strange queen is introduced into a hive a oombat
to the death takes place between her and the reigning monaroh.
Similarly, when the swarming season is over, any young queens
left in the royal cells are liberated simultaneously (previously
they aie only liberated one by one when needed for a swarm),
and allowed, or rathei enoouraged, by the other bees to fight
to the death, the survivor being received as sovereign. These
combats tak'e place inside the hive, and seem only to be
between the queens themselves. On the other hand actual
fig hts between bees occur when as often happens, the bees

these two quite separate forms of encounter into one imagin-
ative scene.
