48 VERG. GEORG. IV.

1963 but, as Conington remarks, ‘the general integrity of
Virgirs text is quite beyond suspicion’, and the connection
of thought seems to be that indicated 111 the suinmary.
virgil points out that though the sema-le bees do not supply
the state with citizens as Roman mati-ons did, still the
maintenance of the state was due to their continued care
and sels-sacrifice.

197. illum] ‘this'‚ pointing forward to quod; adeo em-
phasizes it, ‘this of all conceivable customs', ‘this strange
custom'. For adeo thus appended to a single word which
it'einphasizeS. cf. Ecl. 4. 113 G. 1. 11 tuque adeo3 Ecl. 9. 59
hinc adeo ‘from just here’3 G. 1. 94 multum adeo ‘very
much '.

198. quod...] ‘that they neither indulge in marriage nor
idly enervate their bodies in love or bring forth young with
travail ³.

200. ipsae] ‘by themselves’, i.e. without the male. The
same account is given, among others, by Aristotle. As a
matter of fact, the queen bee is fertilized from a drone, and
then lays eggs at the rate of at least two hundred a day, which
are then taken 111 charge by some of the working bees. In
five days the larvae are developed, spin for themselves a
cocoon‚ and are transformed into pupae, from which the
perfect insect is hatched in seven or eight days.

⁵201. Quiritem aulas3 cerea regna] Note the human char-
acter given to the bees.

204. ultroque...] ‘and voluntarily laid down life beneath
their burden'; the bees bringing home honey are compared
to soldiers who march (G. 3. 346 acer Romanus in, armislin-
iusto subfasce viam cum carpit) until they drop dead. Ultro,
connected with ultra, often describes an act which is purely
voluntary‚ Which goes beyond anything which might reason-
ably have been expected. You might expect a bee to give
up its burden to save its live, but it will not. Cf. 265 n.

206. ergo] see summary. ipsas: i.e. the individua] bees
as contrasted with the race; ‘the limit of his narrow span
awaits’ the individual, ‘ yet the race remains imperishable ’.
Virgil speaks of the bees, but is thinking of the Romans who,
as Lincoln said of the dead at Gettysburg, “gave their lives
that the nation might live ''.
