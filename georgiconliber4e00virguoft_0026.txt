xxii “ INTRODUCTION.

emotion underlies the habitual quiet and reflective-
ness of Virgil’s temper. That book indeed reveals
an intensity of feeling and a dramatic power, of
which the rest of his writings afford little sign3
but there is another book of the Aeneid which rises
to a still higher level and places virgil in the fore-
most ranke of poetry. The sixth Book is beyond
praise: to it Virgil chiefly owes his fame 3 it is
here that he exhibite, in fullest measure, the highest
poetic powers of imagination and invention; it is
here that we find the Virgil who is worthy to
wall< side by side with Dante, and with whom John
Bunyan and John Milton are to ,be compared. As
we pass with him into the under world, by the
sole force of genius he makes a dream seem to us
a living fact 3 he commands our thoughts to follow
whithersoever he leads them, and they obey 3 under
his guidance we tread with ghostly but unhesitating
footsteps that dim and unknown highway which
extends beyond the grave.

For an ordinary man, however, to criticise Virgil is
almost an impertinence. It needs a poet to appreciate
a poet, and the judgment of Alfred Tennyson out-
weighs that of a host of critics and commentators.
There could be no more just and happy tribute
from one master to another than the following Ode
addressed by the English to the Roman Virgils‘k
