NOTES. 51

deum: cf. Pope, Essay on Man 3. 22 ‘One all-extending,
all-preserving Soul': Arat. Phaen. 2 μεσταὶ δὲ Διὸς πᾶσαι μὲν
ἀγυιαί, Ι πᾶσαι δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἀγοραί, μεστὴ δὲ θάλασσα.

222. terrast-fic] Virgil is fond of thus lengthening que
before a double consonant in imitation of Homer’s lengthening
of τε as in Λάμπον τέ Κλύτιόν τε, ΙΙροδοήνωρ τέ Κλύτιός re:
G. l. 153 lappaeqzae tribulique, 164 tribulaque traheaeque.

223. Note the double contrast in pecudes) (armenta and
νίν-03)( ferarum.

224. tenues] Because of the extreme subtlety of this vital
principle, which Virgil regards as somehow possessing sub-
stance, but so refined as to be almost unsubstantial. In this
he follows Lucretius, who regards the soul as tenuis aura
(De Rer. Nat. 3. 232) than which there is nothing tenuius.

225. reddi, resoluta, referri] assonance emphasizing the idea
that death is not death, but a mere returning of the spirit
to its original home. resoluta: ‘broken up' noc destroyed,
the body separating into its constituent elements, the soul
‘ winging its way alive ’ back to heaven. ef. Eccl. xii. 7. '

227. sideris in numerum] ‘to join the starry host ', but
the use of sideris for siderum is remarkable. Compare, how-
ever, the use of {flandi-s· 81 =‘acorns ⁷, and &Vagner thinks
that Virgil is imitating Lucr. 1. 437 corporis azzqebic numerum ;
cf. too Ov. Tr. 2. 567, inter tot scripti milia nostru Eur.
Beller. 25 λό’γχης ἀριθμῷ πλείονος κρατούμεναι. Others given:
in modum sideris ‘after the fashion of a star’3 Keunedy
‘ into the eluster of a constellation ’.

228-238. When you take the homey, as you may do in spring]
mul autumn, rin-se your monela and use smoke (ιο drive away
the bees), as when anqerecl they Scina.

228. angustam3 230. ora fove] It is impossible to decide
between this reading and the alternative anglus-tam ore sare.
The latter suits the stately word thesauris, but is perhaps
somewhat too exaggerated: Benoist well explains it, ‘Pour
approcher de la demeure auguste des abeilles il faut s’etre
purifie et garder le silence' (cf. Aen. 5. 71).

229. relines] The regular word for opening a wine-jar by
breaking the seal : here of openi'nu the hioe, and unsa-eteniny
ssggfcombs by breaking the wax which attaches them to the
