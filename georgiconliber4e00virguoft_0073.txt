NOTES 43

They have a king and officers of sorts ;

&Vliere some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armecl in their stings
Make boot upon the suminer’s velvet buds,
Which pillage they with inerry march bring home
To the tent—royal of their emperor3

Who, buried in his majesty, surveys

The singing niasons building roofs of gold,

The civil citizens kneading up the honey,

The poor mechanie porters crowding in

Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,

The sad-eyed justice, with his surly huni,
Delivering o‘er to executore pale

The lazy yawning drone ''.

153. solae] ‘The ancients knew very little of the other
socia] insects—wasps‚ hornets⁷ ants' : Sidgwick. communes
natos: as in the ideal Republic of Plato (457 D) καὶ τοὺς
παῖδας αὖ κοινούς. consortia tecta urbis habent: lit. ‘they
possess the dwellings of their city in partnership’; consors
is strictly one who shares any property (sors) with another, a
‹zo-heir, a partner, but is here used of the property thus held
in partnership (ef. Prop. 1. 21. 1 consortem casum), and
consortia is exactly parallel to communes. Conington
strangely gives ‘ dwellings united into a city ‘, making
urbis the emphatic word.

154. agitant aevum] a heroic phrase; cf. Aen. 10. 235
ec dedic esse deas aevumque aslitare sub undis; Enn. 10. (353)
qui tum vivebam homines aevumque aqitabant: ib. (Cic.
Tusc. 1. 12. 28) Romulus in caelo cum dis agyit aevum. For
a9ito=a90 in the sense of ‘ passing’ time3 cf. G. 2. 527 dies
agitat festos.

155. certos...] Cf. l. 43.

157. in medium...] ‘gamer their gains into a common
store'. Virgil is fond of using neuter adjectives as sub-
stantives, especially with a preposition. So here in
medium=es τὸ κοινόν and quaesitaz‘ gains’; cf. 6 in tenui
‘on a trivial theme'; 25. 157 in medium; 126 culta ‘tillcd
lands3 239 sucuro ‘the future'3 303 in clauso. In Latin
prose such words as bonum, honestum, pulchrum, utile are
continually used instead of abstraet substantives.
