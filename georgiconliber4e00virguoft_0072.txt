42 VERG. GEORG. IV.

147. spatiis...] ‘debarred (i.e, from doing so) by scanty
space’; cf. Aen. 5. 203 spacio iniquo. He has no room to
expatiate on the subject.

148. aliis] The task was undertaken by Columella, the
tenth Book of whose treatise de Re Rustica is entitled de
cultu hortorum and written in hexameters ut poeticis numeris
explerem Geor-(lici carminis omissas partes, quas tamen et ipse
l'eryilius sigyniftcaverat posteris se memorandas relinquere.

149-218. The remarkable instinctis os bees (which are de-
scribed 153-218) were ⁴qiven them in payment sor their
services to the infant Jupiter.

149. naturas] ‘qualities’, ‘instincts’.

150. addidit] The bees are described as not originally
possessing their exceptional instincts, but as receiving them
in addition to their previous ordinary ones as the ‘pay for
which’ (pro qua mercede) they agreed to seed Jupiter. The
legend was that Cronos (Saturn) (levoured his children because
he knew that one of them was to depose him, but that his
mother hid Jupiter in a cave of Mt. Dicte in Crete, and the
Curetes (see Vocab.) drowned his eries by clashing their cymbals
(Lucr. 2. 633 seq. ; Ov. Fast. 4. 207), while the bees, attracted
by the sound (ef. line 64), provided the infant with honey.

153-178. Bees alone ofliviny creature-5 have α sociat oryaniz-
atich under which children, houses, and 900ds are held in
common, and all in their various offioes labour to lay up the
stores which are to support the whole community thronqh the
winter ; some collectiva fuod, some buildirffl, others traininy the
youny, packiizsy honey, or keepinsy quai-d at the qates. The scir
ancl (msice is like that in the workshops of the Cyclopes.

The ‘ division of labour ’ is always the mark of an advanced
social life, and its existence among bees is noted by Aristotle
(H. A. 9. 40 ; see Con.): but the best illustration of Virgil
and the best commentary on him is Shak. Henry V. 1. 2. 183

“ Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of inan in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion ;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience ε for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
