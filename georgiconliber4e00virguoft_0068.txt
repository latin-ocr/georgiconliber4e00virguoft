:38 VERG. GEORG. IV.

116. equidem] Cf. 147 ipsc equidem. This word (from e
demonstrative and quidem) has no connection with egla, but is
a simple adverb and can be used with the 211d or 3rd person.
None the less Virgil certainly seems to treat it as z cllo quidem,
cf. Ecl. 1. 11 non equidem invideoe 9. 7 certe equidem aucam-am
G. 1. 193 vidi equidem ; 415 hand equidem credo. So here and
147 it emphasizes his own pomonal disability to deal With the
theme in spite of its eininently poetical character. extremo
‘ were I not, almost at my labour's extreme goal, already furl-
ing (traham = contraham) sail ...‚ perchance too Ι might have
been singing ³. The change of tense in ni cranam and
forsitan canerem seems clearly intended to contrast what
is actually happening with what maylan have happened.
Kennedy’s view that the apodosis to ni . . . traham is to be found
in forsitan :fors sit an ‘ there might be a chance that ’‚ seems
artificial. For the naval metaphor, cf. G. 2. 41 pelaqoque
volans da vela patenti of connnencing his song.

119. rosaria Paesti] Ov. Met. 15. 708; Prop. 5. 5. 61;

Met. 4. 42. 10, etc. biferi: cf. δίφορος, δίκαρπος, ‘blooming
twice in a year ’.

ornaret] following the tense of canerem, ‘I might have
been singing what care of cultivation made gardens gay ' ι 50
too 9anderent, cresceret. We should use the present.

121. tortusque...] ‘and winding through the grass the
cucumber grows into a belly’. tortus refers 130 the growth
of the plant (cf. cucumis anyninus Varro, R. R. 1. 2. 25)
more than to that of the fruit, which is perhaps rather ‘a

go‘tssdu' ⁰‚r ‘ melon ' than a euoumber, which hardly grows into
a e y .

122. sera comantem] ⁴ late-blooming' ; for sera ε adm, cf.
270 n. Theophrastus, H. P. 6. 6. 9 says that the narcissus is
often called λείριον (= lilium), and adds ὄψιον δὲ σφόδρα, μέτα
’γὰρ ἀκτοῦρον ὴ ἄνθησις καὶ περὶ ἰσημερίαν. Dioscorides says of
it ἄνθος λευκόν, ἔσωθεν δὲ κροκῶδες ἐπ’ ἐνίων δὲ πορφυροειδές, and
so Pliny flore candido, calyce purpureo (cf. Ecl. 5. 38 purpureo
narcisso). ‘Hence ³, Martyn writes, ‘we may be sure that
some species of our daffodil is the narcissus of the ancients,
and probably the narcissus albus circulo purpureo ². To the
objection that claffodils are springy flowers, he replies that they
grow at Constantinople and in Asia Minor in December.
