76 VERG. GEORG. IV.

485. iamque ...] Virgil assumes a knowledge of the story
in his readers, and only mentions the ⁴ giving back ' (reddita)
of Eurydice to her husband, and the conditions (leyem) on
which she was given back parenthetically. casus evaserat:
evado, ‘to pass out’, becomes transitive in the secondary
sense of ‘ to escape from '; cf. Aen. 5. 438 tela exit.

487. hanc legem] ‘this condition' (cf. foedera, 493),
ἷιέἐὲεὲζέἓῗέὴεὲῗ should follow him and that he should not

488. amantem] emphatic: it was ‘love’ that caused him
to look back. Hence his error was ‘pardonable indeed, did
but the powers below know how to pardon ⁷; cf. Pope, ‘No
crime was thine, if ’tis no crime to love '.

489. quidem] = μέν, and the antithesis ought strictly to be
‘ but the grave never pardons ³.

490. suam] ‘his own ³, as he fondly thought, and as, with
an instant more of patience, she would have been. The same
idea is brought out in the words which follow; it was when
‘ now just at the very entrance to light' that he looked back.

491. victus animi] ‘yielding in his purpose⁷; his passion
overcame his determination. animi is the locative case (like
domi, humi); cf. G. 3. 289 nec sum animi dubiu3; Aen. 6. 332
sortemque animi miseratus iniquam. ibi omnisleffusus labor:
note the sense of sudden change produced (l) by the break
and full stop after respexit quite at the end of the verse, and
(2) by the brevity and abruptness of these four words.

492. inmitis tyranni] Pluto.

493. terque fragor...] the ‘crash ⁷ is that of subterranean
thunder, the words being added to suggest awe and terror.
Martyn quotes Milton, P.L. 9. 782, where at the Fall ‘ Earth
felt the wound, and Nature from her seat, Ι Sighing through
all her works, gave signs of woe Ι That all was lost', and
1000 ‘Earth trembled from her entrails as again Ι In pangs’3
but in those passages Nature is made to sympathize and
share in the suffering caused, whereas here there is no such
intention, and the effect is purely dramatic. Avernis: an
adj.=Avernian. In poetry proper names are often used as
adjectives without any alteration in shape, e. g. Romula
tellus, Bledum flumen, Sulpiciis horreis. There was a fabled
entrance to hell at Lake Avernus near Cumae (see Aen. 6.
