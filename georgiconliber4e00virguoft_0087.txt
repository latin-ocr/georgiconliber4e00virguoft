281-294. In case any one lose-s his whole stock of bees, I will
'now relate αι lenam the memorable discovery of Aristaeus for

281. si defecerit, nec habebit] Conington well points
out that the difference of tense indicates a difference of time,
just as in speaking of present time we might say proles eum
defecit, nec haben· -, ‘ if his breed shall hare failed him, and he
shall (then) be ignorant whence ...'.

283. et] ‘also '‚ i.e. in addition to my previous precepts.
Arcadii magistri: Aristaeus, cf. 317. He was a great
authority on agriculture (ef. G. 1. 14) and especially on bees,
but his connection with Arcadia is unknown.

284. quoque...] ‘and how often ere now when cattle have
been slaughtered the putrifying blood has produced bees '.
That bees will settle in a decaying carcase is well known
(cf. the story of Samson, Judges xiv. 8 “and behold, there
was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion '')‚
and they were commonly supposed to be produced by the
putrefaction, especially from oxen, cf. Varro de R. R. 2. 5 ex

its boundaries (1) on the W. for Canopus is its most westerly
town, (2) on the E„ cf. vicinia Persidis, and (3) on the S.
amuis dez-emas αῖ) Indis, 293. Others say that the delta only
is referred to, and make line 291 mark its S. point, but lines
291-‘2 clearly refers to the rest of Egypt. The whole passage is
diffuse, and lines 291-:3 vary in order in MSS„ but there is no
reason to suspect any of them, for these ‘learned' descrip-
tions were popular in antiquity (cf. the learned list of rivers
367 seq.) and are not out of place in a didactic poem.
Pellaei : ‘Macedonian ⁵, because Alexandria close by was
built by Alexander, and also because Egypt after his death
passed under the Macedonian Ptolemies. fortunata ; because
of the richness of the soil.
