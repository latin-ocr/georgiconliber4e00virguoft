good sense, confidem· in classical Latin has a bad one = ‘ im-
pudent ', cf. Cic. Tusc. 4. 7. 14 qui fortis est, idem est
fideus,· quoniam confidens, mala consuetudine loquendi, in vicio
ponatur.

447. ipse] i.e. without my telling thee. neque est : ‘nor
is it possible to deceive thee in aught, but do thou (on thy
part) cease to wish (to deceive me)'. Proteus is νημερτής
(0(1. 4. 384), but as he cannot be deceived so he should cease
attempting to deceive Aristaeus. The emphatic tu makes the
antithesis clear: to deceive thee is impossible)(do not thou
seek to deceive me. Other explanations are : (1) ‘ Thou canst
not deceive me by pretending ignorance, so cease to attempt

under strong compulsion rolled upon him...'. The rage
which the god exhibits is due to his being forced to answer.
Others explain it as a sign of prophetie fury, prophets when
inspired exhibiting signs of frenzy, which were supposed to
indicate divine possess ion, cf. the ease of the Sibyl, Aen. 6.
47-51f, 77-801; but a god surely does not become thus possessed

451. glauco] ‘ light-blue ’ or ‘ gray', the colour of Athene's
eyeS‚ who is γλαυκῶπις : it marks a fierce gleam.
