xxiv INTRODUCTION.

VI,

Thou that satist Universal
Nature moved by Universal Mind;

Thou majestic in thy saduess
at the doubtful doom of human kind;

VII.
Light among the vanish’d ages;
star that gildest yet this phantom shore 3

Golden branch amid the shadows,
kings and realms that pass to rise no more

VIII.

Now thy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar’s dome—-
Tho' 'chine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Rome-

IX.

Now the Rome of slaves hath perjsh’d,

and the Rome of freemen holds her place,
I, from out the Northern Island

sunder'd once from all the human race,

X.

I salute thee, Mantovano,

I that loved thee since my day began,
WVielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.
