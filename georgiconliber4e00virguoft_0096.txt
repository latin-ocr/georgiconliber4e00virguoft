roar ; cf. Il. 21. 237 μεμυκὼς ἠΰτε ταῦρος of the Xanthus ; Eur.

cornigler of the Tiber 3 Hor. Od. 4. 14. ‘25 tanrzjformz's Aufidus.
The horns of bulls were often gilded for sacrifice.

373. mare purpureum] Homer’s ἅλα πορφυρέην (11. 16. 391)
which some explain ‘ t-roubled ⁹, others ‘ (larkly-gleaming (see
L. and S. sav. πορφύρεος). Catullus 64. 275 says of the waves,
when the sea is stirred by wind in bright sunshine, purpurea
nantes α luce resldqent, and purpureus here seems clearly to
describe (1) the deep colour of the sea, and (2) the shimmer
or radiance of the moving waveS‚ cf. 54. violentior: for the
fury of the river, cf. G. 1. 48⁴2 proluit insano contorquens
vertice silvas Ι fluviorum rex Eridanus.

374. in thalaml ...] ‘ beneath her chamber's roof o'er-arched
with fretted stone '. In Cic. Tusc. Disp. l. 37 a trochaic line is
quoted from some old poet per speluncas saxis structas asperis
pendentibus ; so Lucr. 6. 195 compares clouds piled up into an
arching mass to speluncas... saccis pendentibus structam cf.
Aen. l. 167 scopulis pendentibus antrum ; Ov. Her. 15. 141
antra pendentia tofo. These passages show that pendere is
specially used of the appearance of the gradually over-arching
walls of a natural cave or grotto, which seem to any one
looking up to ‘ hang ’ unsupported. In Mart. 2. 14. 9 centum
pendentia tecta columnis is a description of the Hecatostylon
at Rome, and the addition of colmnm‘s makes the passage
quite different from this, so that to render here ‘supported
on (columns of) pumice’ seems forced.

375. cognovit] i.e. learnt the cause or history of. inanes:
partly because all tears are ‘idle' (cf. Tennyson, Princess iv.
“Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean ''), partly
because she had been really alarmed at her son’s trouble,
whereas now she knows that she can relieve it.

376. manibus] Cf. Od. l. 136 χέρνιβα δ’ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ
ἐπέχευε φέρουσα. ordine : ‘in order due ⁵, i.e. according to the
proper order of a feast, which prescribes this initial washing
of the hands, cf. 537. The whole procedure is Homerio, as
is also the practice of oflering food to a guest before discussing
his business

377. tonsis ...] ‘ napkins with close—shorn nap '‚ i.e. delicate,
not rough or coarse.
