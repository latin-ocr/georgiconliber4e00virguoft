24 VERG. GEORG. IV.

10. ferre prohibent] ‘prevent their carrying.’ The in-
finitive is so convenient metrically that its use is very
frequent in poetry after verbs of cle-sirius), ars-leina, J'orbz'cldiny,
tryiny, ete, which would not ordinarily take it in prose, cf.
23 invite! decedere ; 84 obnixi ηοιι cedere; 117 fias-linem adver-
tere; 249 incumbent sarcire; 489 scirent igynoscere. Cf. its
use after adjectives, 134 n.

13. et] ‘ also ³. squalentia, ‘sealy', of. 91 n.

14. meropes] The merops apiascer or ‘hee-eater’‚ a bird

father sor a meal. When pursued by Tereus she was changed
into a swallow and her sister Philomela into a nightingale.
The blood upon her hands is still supposed to stain her
plumage, and in fact the common chimney—swallow has a deep
claret-coloured patch on the throat.

else but also even carried off the bees. Surely‚ however,
birds do not ‘destroy everything', though they may make
‘utter destruction among bees. volantes might be a subst. Ξ
‘winged creatures ' and so ‘ bees', but it would be awkward
to call bees volantes here, where they are contrasted with
birds, which are also volantes ; hence it is best taken as a
participle. '

17. nidis inmitibus] ‘pitiless nestlings'; cf. Aen. 12, 474
hirundo Ι pabula parva leyens nidisque loquacibus escas

18. at liquidi fontes ...] ‘ Water is essential during spring
and summer3 a shallow pebbly stream in the vicinity will,
therefore, be most advantageous, where they can drink
without danger of drowning. Its absence should be supplied
by artifieial means ; and a shallow vessel of water having a,
few smooth round stones thrown into it (cf. 25) of a size to
⁴project above the surface and afford footing to the drinkers,
will answer the end. The neighbourhood of large sheets of
water, however, or of broad rivers, is injurious; the little
