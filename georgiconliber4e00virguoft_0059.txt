NOTES. 29

59. nare ...] ‘ float ’mid the liquid summer air ’. Liquiclus
suggests two ideas: (1) liquid, (2) clear, pure: here in con-
nection with nare the first is more prominent, but the other
is present. Cf. G. 1. 404 liquido in aere where both are equally
suggested; Eel. 6. 33 liquidi isynis where the first prevails3
G. l. 410 liquidas voces. Elsewhere it is used as an epithet
of lux, nox, tempestas, mens, animus (Ξ ‘ serene '), voluptas.

60. obscuramque...] ‘ and marvel at the dark cloud trailiug
in the wind ' 3 for trahi, cf. trahi nubes 557 of actual clouds,
ἶῐῖιιεέωξῗι· nubes metaphorically, cf. Aen. 7. 705 volucrum...

flowered honey-wort, and is one of the most common herbs
all over Italy and Sicily ⁷. He adds that it grows to a height
of between one and two feet, so that iqnobile had better be
taken ‘lowly’ (=comnion) rather than ‘low—growing’ (for
which cf. G. 2. 213 humiles casias), but it is difficult to be
sure of the exact force of adjectives applied to plants the
identification of which is doubtful.

64. Matris ...] i.c. Cybele, a Phrygian goddess, whose
worship was introduced at Rome during the Hannibalic war,
and who was identified with Earth ‘ the Great Mother’ of all
things. Her ritual was of an oriental character, and cymbals
were used in her worship; for their use in the East cf. Ps.
cl. 5. Our ⁶ key and warming-pan’ afford a striking contrast
here with Virgil’s heroic style.

66. intima cunabula] i.c. the hive which is offered to the
