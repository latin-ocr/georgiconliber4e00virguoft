NOTES. 67

378. et plena reponunt pocula] This might: ‘ replace the
goblets full' i.e. as soon as they are emptied (cf. repostae
G. 3. 527), but, as Virgil is describing the feast in its
successive acts, it is better to explain ‘and then (i.e. after
the eating is done) in turn serve the brimming goblets'.
After dinner came what we call dessert, and it was then that
the wine was formally introduced and drinking, preceded by
solemn libations, began.

379. Panchaeis ignibus] ‘the flames of Panchaean frank-
incense ' ; cf. Ov. Met. 15. 754 placat odorans herbosas iynibus
aras ‘with perfumed flames ' z with the flames of incense.

adolescunt: there is no parallel for this use of adolesco
which perhaps means ‘ blaze ' with a collateral suggestion of
‘growing ’‚ ‘rising higher'. The active adoleo is fairly
common = ‘ make blaze ³ or ‘ burn in sacrifice⁷ (e. g. Ecl. 8. 66
verbenasque adole ; Aen. 7. 71 adolet dum altaria taedis), and it
is suggested that it originally meant ‘ increase ' (root OL found
in adolescens, proles, suboles, etc.), and then ‘honour with
sacssficessh‘sacrifice'. The use of adolescunt here seems to
con rm t is.

380. Maeonii] i.e. Lydian3 probably the wine of Mount
Tmolus, cf. G. 2. 98.

382. patrem rerum] Cf. Il. 14. 246 Ὠκεανοῦ ὅσπερ ’γένεσις
πάντεσσι τέτυκται, and 201 Ὠκεανόν τε, θεῶν γένεσιν, καὶ μητέρα
Τηθύν. In Homer Oceanus merely takes an early place in the
genealogy of the gods, but Virgil combines with this a re-
ference to the philosophical theory of Thales, that water was
the source of all things. Cf. too the common application of
pater to sea and river gods 355 n.

384. ter...] The wine is poured on ‘ the blazing hearth’
to cause a momentary blaze, which was considered auspicious,

cf. Ecl. 8. 1063 Ov. Her. 13. 113 ut solet effuso sumere
stamma mero.

385. subiecta] ‘ shooting up '‚ cf. Ecl. 10. 74. reluxit :
‘ shone out ' ς re suggests a contrast between the sudden flash
and the previous obscurity.

386. animum] Clearly not ‘ her' mind but ‘his ’3 in addi
tion to encouraging him with this omen from heaven, she also
addresses himself ‘ herself ² (ipsa).
