78 VERG. GEORG. IV.

511. qualis ...] The notes of the nightingale were supposed
to be the lament of Philomela for her son Itys or Itylus, and
Homer 011. 19. 518-523 compares Penelope's mourning to hers
in a simile which Virgil copies here, though 118 alters it by
introducing an actual nightingale that has lost its young,
borrowing this idea from another simile of Homer (Od. 16. 216)
in which Telemachus and his father wept ἀδινώτερον ἤ τ’
οἰωνοί...οἷσι’ τε τέκνα 1 ἀγρόται ἐξείλοντο πάρος πετεηνὰ γενέσθαι.

514. flet noctem] ‘ weeps all night long ⁷. The phrase seems
to have been in Milton’s mind when he wrote of the ‘wakeful
nightingale' that ‘She all night long her amorous descant
sung’, P. L. 4. 603. ramoque: cf. δενδρέων ἑν πετάλοισι καθε-
ζομένη πυκινοῖσι, Hom. Od. 19. 520.

516. Venus] ‘ passion ³.

517. Hyperboreas, Tanais, Rhipaeis] The words all de-
scribe the unknown and wintry wilds to the north of Thrace.

5113. Inumquam viduata] ‘never widowed from ’‚ ‘ never un-
we 8( 10 .

519. raptam inrita] The emphasis is on the adjectives and
not 011 1118 nouns Eurydicen and dona: he laments ‘the loss
of Eurydice⁷ and ⁶ the vanity of Pluto’s boon ⁹, cf. 512 amissos
queriturfetus ι ‘ laments the loss of her young ².

520. spretae] ‘ scorned (i.e. feeling themselves scorned) by
such devotion the Thracian dames ...⁷. munus is any ‘ gift’
but especially any ‘tribute’ to the dead, cf. Aen. 4. 624
cinerique haec millite nostro Ι munera, where the tribute Dido
asks for from her people is undying hate of Rome, 6. 886.

521. inter sacra ...] The worship of Dionysius (or Bacchus)
specially prevailed in Thrace, and during the ‘ orgies’ (ὄργια,
‘celebration of sacred rites ') which took place at night. the
female worshippers (Βάκχαι, Θυιάδες, Μαινάδες) worked them-
selves up into a state of frenzy. It was in 11115 condition that
they chanced upon Orpheus and rent him limb from limb as a
despiser of themselves and their deity. Apparently this

‘ rending’ to pieces of the victim had a ritual significance, see
the case of Pentheus Eur. Bacch. 1125 seq.

523. revulsum] ‘rent ⁵, ‘t-o1·n'.

5⁶24. Oeagrius] ‘Oeagrius was father of Orpheus, so that
