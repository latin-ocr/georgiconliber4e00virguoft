Norns. 75

The whole of this Orpheus passage is imitated in Pope’s
Ode for St. Cecilia’s Day (§1v. to end), which should be
carefully compared.

472. tenues] In Aen. 6. 292 the ghosts are tenues sine
corpore vitas, the adj. expressing that which is ‘ fine '‚ ‘ thin ³,
‘ unsubstantial’3 cf. line 500. This passage is repeated with
some alteration in Aen. 6. 305 seq.

473. quam multa. ...] ‘ many as the thousands of birds that
shelter themselves in the woods when ...'.

475. corpora heroum] Not a mere periphrasis: heroes,
but calling attention to their heroic build; cf. G. 3. 51, 169;
Aen. 2. 18 delecta virum corpora.

476. magnanimum] The only adjective in which Virgil uses
this contracted gen.‚ which is common (1) with proper names,
e. g. Danaum, and (2) with names describing a class of persons,
eg. divom, caelicolum.

478. quos] probably governed by adligat, circum being
adverbial 3 ‘ whom all around the black mud confines '.

479. Cocyti] the river of lamentation (κωκυτὸς); cf. Milton,
P. L. 2. 579 ‘Cocytus named of lamentation loud'. tarda-
que repeated Aen. 6. 438. The palus is the Styx with
its slow, winding, stagnant stream. inamabilis : ‘ unlovely '‚
and so, by litotes, z ‘hateful', suggesting the derivation of
Styx from στύγος.

481. quin ipsae...] ‘nay even the very halls (i.e. and not
merely their inhabitants) were amazed ³. intima. z ‘inmost ’.
Tartarus is the very lowest pit (cf. Aen. 6. 577) and in the
utmost depths of hell.

482. caeruleos ...] ‘ that have dark blue snakes entwined in

tifiei3r37100ks ². For the construction (εόφεις ἐμπεπλεγμέναι)
c ‚⁸ n.

483. tenuit inhians] ‘ held agape '.

484. vento constitit] exactly like cvm placidum ventis staret
mare Ecl. 2. 26 where the sea is said to be calmed by the
winds, i.e. by their stopping. Orpheus lulled the wind
tro rest (ef. Hor. Od. 1. 11. 10), and as it stops it causes the
wheel to stop.
