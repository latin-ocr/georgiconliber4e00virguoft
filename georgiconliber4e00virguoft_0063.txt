NOTES. 33

79. magnum ...] ‘crowded together they are rolled into a
ginglsstzygaffiagssss orbis is the ball-shaped mass of struggling

80. praecipitesque cadunt] ‘and fall head foremost’. Notice
the double sense of cadunt ; warriors ‘ fall ’ on the ground and
the bees ‘ fall ’ to it.

Sl. tantum glandis] lit. ‘ so much of acorns ' ; ‚qlandis is
used collectively, as miles is often = ‘ soldiers ’, of. 227 n.
‘ Nor do the acorns rain so thick from '.

82. ipsi] ‘they themselves’, i.e. clearly the chiefs in con-
trast with their followers. insignibus alis: ‘with conspicuous
pinions ⁷. The wings of a queen bee are comparatively small,
but Columella, 9, 10, describes them as specially beautiful,

83. ingentes.. ] ‘keep alive in their tiny beart a giant's
eourage'. animi in the plur. is regularly used = ‘temper’‚
‘courage ³, ‘ spirit ³, and rersare implies activity. The phrase
animos versare must be distinguished from animum versare
(Aen. 4. 286 animum per omnia versat ,· 630 animum partes
versabat in omncs) z ‘turn the mind in every direction',

excipere, and vfor the infinitive following it, cf. 1011. Kennedy,
who, like many others, considers that a subj. is needed,
takes subesyil as ‘a syncopated form of subeyerit’, but this
is improbable, nor is the subj. required, for, though where the
idea of purpose is clear (lum and donec are followed by the
subj., yet Virgil here merely describes what actually happens.
He does not say that the resolution of the chiefs is ‘not to

yield until '‚ which would require a subj., but he describes '

mental resolution or purpose, that resolution is contained in
the words non cedere, and does not extend to the clause intro-
