49. aut ubi ‚..] How far bees possess the senso of hearing
has beon disputed, but it seems certain that they dislike
noisc, and an apiary situated near mills, smithies, or other
noisy workshops is seldom prosperous.

50. vocisque...] ‘and the echo of a voice rcbounds after
striking them (i.e. the rocks) '. Imaqo (=mima(10‚ cf. imitor
= φηίφηίίον, ‘ inimic ') is thc regular word for an echo z strictly
it is tho sound (vox) itself which strikes (offendiIur) the rock
and only the echo (imasJo) which ⁶ rebounds ³.

homey, and begyz'n to breed, baim cells, and Swarm. When
they sec-arm they always· make for crees and water. Attracc
them to such α spot by rubbiny tlte bouyh-s‘ with sweec-scented
herb-e, ancl claslt cymbals ,· they wilc readily settle οη the pre-

messis. purpureos: ‘bright ², cf. Ecl. 9. 40, ver purpureum
‘ flower-decked spring '. The ancient purple had two charac-
teristics : (1) its peculiar hue, the colour of clotted blood ; (2) a,
remarkable sheen. Hence it may have been (1) purple or (2)
‘gleaming'‚ ‘bright’‚ as in Horace's purpurei olores (Od. 4.

(lcinc=posfi hoc) deseribing the succession of their acts, but
rather ‘ therefore ' (hinc z propter hoc). The result of the warm
weather and their feast in the fields is that ‘joyous with a
marvellous delight’, on their return horne they busy them-
selves With the hive, building their cells, rearing their young,
and finally (iam 58) ponring forth their superabundant popu-
lation in a swarm. Cf. G. 1. 412, where the effect of fine
weather on crows is described as producing exactly the same
‘ marvellous delight’ in their homes.

emendent aliz· spirantia mollius aera.
