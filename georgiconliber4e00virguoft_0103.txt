453. non te nullius] Emphatic litotes: ‘assuredly some
wrath divine dogs thee ³. Conington compares Eur. Iph. A.
809 οὐκ ἄνευ &eom Aesoh. Ag. 649 οὐκ ἀμήνιτον θεοῖς. nullius
exercent: Virgil not infrequently lengthens a short vowel in
arsis (i.e. when the accent of the verse falls on it) cf. 92 melior

460. chorus aequalis D.] ‘ the band of her comrade Dryads’.
