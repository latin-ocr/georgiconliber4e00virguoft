flowers are fed on by bees (ef. erqo), it is more likely that he

139. apibus fetis] inconsistent with 198 seq.

140. spumantia] the honey when taken from the combs
was left standing in earthenware vessels open to the air for a
few days ‘until fermentation ceased' (dam musteus fructus
defervescat), the scum being frequently removed, Col. 9. 15.
cogere: ‘ gather'‚ cf. 231. pressis: ef. 101 11.

141. tiliae] ‘ limes ’ when in flower are great favourites with
bees. The ‘pine ' is also mentioned as acceptable to them
in 112, possibly for its resinous exudations, but more probably

forlthe sake of the clouds of pollen-(lust produced by the ripe
ma e eones.

142. quotque...] ‘and as many as were the fruits with
which in early flower the productive tree had dressed itseff,
so many ripe in autumn it retained’: i. e. each blossom set
and came to maturity. Of course when a tree is in flower
there can be no fruits (poma), so that pomis can only refer to
the promise of fruit which each blossom holds. For induerat
cf. G. 1. 187 cum se mcx plurima silvis Ι induet in florem,
‘ shall don its robe of blossom ³. matura: sc. poma, though
Conington refers it to arbos.

eduram‚ iam pruna ferentes, iam min. umbras are all
emphatic. His skill was shown by his moving trees when no
one else could3 he could do so when owing to their age it

seemed too late, when the wood was no longer young but
‘ very hard ³, etc.

145. spinos] “ I have translated spinos in this place ‘thorns’,
because the plum is a thorny tree; and because our wild
sort, which bears the sloes, is called ‘the black-thorn',
prunus spinosa ’': Martyn.

146. ministrantem...] The plane-tree (πλάτανος, from
πλατύς ‘broad ¹) was frequently planted in gardens because
of the grateful shade afforded by its broad leaves3 cf. Hor.
