52 VERG. GEORG. IV.

230. ora fove] ‘rinse thy mouth’: cf. G. 2. 135 musonem,
and for this use offoewm line 43 n. Becs are very sensitive to
certain smells, and Columella (9. 41) recommends that any
one, before taking honey, should not only bathe but abstain
from any strong-smelling food such as onions.

³ fumosque ] ‘ and with thy hand direct in front pursuing
smoke'. The object of the smoke is stated by Columella
(9. 15), who gives an elaborate description of a fumigator, to
be to drive away the bees (cf. sequaces) and not to stupefy
them.

231. bis ...] ‘twice do they (the bee-keepers) gather in the
heavy yield ': forfetus of any ‘ produce ⁷, cf. G. ⁶2. 442 silvae
dant alios aliae fetus where it is applied to timber, and Ov.
Fast. l. 693 triticeos fetus. Some make the bees the nom. to
canunt, but the idea of the bees first harvesting the honey and
then the bee-keepers doing so would present a harsh contrast.
messis: cf. Columella 9. 15. l llaec mellis vindemia.

232. Taygete] One of the Pleiades, Which rise early in May

· and set in November. The star is here personified as a

goddess, and so is said to ‘display her comely (cf. G. 2. 392

caput honestum of Bacchus) face ², and to ‘ spurn with her foot
the despised streams of Oceanus ² as she leaps into the air.

233. Oceani amnes] In Homer Ὠκεάνοιο ῥοαί. Note the
ἐῖγῡᾝὲε vigour of this line, and contrast the dull depression

234. sidus ...] The Pleiades set just before the rainy season
when the sun enters Piscem Virgil graphically represents
Taygete as secking to fiy from so gloomy a constellation.

236-9. Many editors place these lines after 231, where they
certainly follow more naturally. Gepp quotes from Sotheby
a fine rendering:

“ The injured swarms with rage insatiate glow,
Barb every shaft and poison every blow ;
Deem life itself to vengeance well resigned—
Die on the W0und‚ and leave their stings behind.”

236. venenum...] The sting of a bee is a finely pointed
tubular instrument which pours poison into the wound ; the
surface is serrated so that it cannot be withdrawn but is torn
out of the body, dragging with it some of the intestines and
so causing death.
