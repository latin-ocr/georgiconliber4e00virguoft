NOTES. 61

315-332. leo first discovered this device ἒ I t was the
sheplzerd Aristonem, who, when lais bees perzlshed, bitterly taunted
his mother with allowinsl him, thongyh the son osa qod, to thus
lose even the ylory of his mortal life.

315] extudit] ‘forged’‚ ‘fashioned'. The word is else-
where (cf. 328 and G. 1. 133 ut varias usus meditando ex-
tunderet arte-3) of slow laborious fashioning by human effort,
but here seems merely to suggest that the plan was not an
easy one to discover.

316. unde ...] ¹ whence did this new experience of men take
its rise ²? The line repeats the preceding line in a new form-
What god discovered, and whence did men derive the plan?
hominum experientia is clearly not men's efforts to discover
the plan, for a god discovered it, but their ‘ acquaintance with
it '. Hence the note of Servius nullo docente ars per usum
reperta is clearly wrong, and how could such a plan be
discovered per nsum?

317. Aristaeus] Aristaeus was a hero, son of Apollo and
Cyrene, afterwards deified for his benefits to mankind in
introducing improved methods of agriculture. He is ad-
dressed as cultor nemorum, G. 1. 14, and was also worshipped
under the titles of Ἀγρεύς, ‘ god of fields ’ and Νόμιος, ⁴ god of
grazing'. Tempe: nent. pl. like τείχη. Aristaeus seems to
have been a very migratory deity, for 283 he is ‘ Arcadian ’‚
here bee-keeping in Thessaly, G. l. 14, keeping herds in Ceos,
while it is in Egypt that he introduces this new discovery.

319. caput] ‘source', cf. 368; Hor. Od. 1. 1. 22 ad aquae
lene caput sacrae. extremi: he has fied up the Peneus all
the way from Tempe, and only halts when he reaches ‘the
hallowed source at the river's end '. sacrum: all rivers and
fountains were held sacred, as specially beloved by nymphs,
river-deities‚ and the like; so here the Peneus is the haunt
of the river-god Peneus, whose daughter, the nymph Cyrene,
dwells in the ‘ depths' of its fountain.

323. si modo...] ‘ if only he whom thou tellest of is my
father, even Thymbraean Apollo ’. The line is imitated from
Od. 9. 529 where the Cyclops appealing to Possidon for aid
says κλῦθι εἰ ἐτεόν ’γε σός εἰμι, πατὴρ δ’ ἐμὸς εὔχεαι εἶναι, and
the suggestion in both cases is that their cruel destiny belies
their supposed divine origin. Thymbra, a district in the
Troad, had a famous temple of Apollo, cf. Aen. 3. 85.
