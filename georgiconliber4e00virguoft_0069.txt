NOTES. 39

123. flexi acanthi] ‘ the stalk of the twining acanthus '.
The plant seems to be acanthus spinosus, ‘bear's-foot’ or
‘ brank-ursine’, so called from the resemblance of its leaf to
a bear’s claw. The sculptor Callimachus is said to have con-
ceived the design of the capital of a Corinthian column from
its leaves growing over a flower-pot‚ and it was commonly
used in artistic decoration, cf. Thcocr. 1. 55 παντᾶ ἀμφὶ δέπας
περιπέπταται ὑγρὸς ἄκανθος, where ὑγρός :flea-us,

124. pallentes hederas] So Ecl. 3. 38 hedera pallente ;
7. 38 hedera alba. The ancient writers all speak of a ‘white
ivy' bearing a white fruit, but Martyn cannot identify it.
Variegated ivies are often strongly marked with white having
some leaves wholly of that colour. amantes z cf. G. 2. 112.

125. Oebaliae] Oebalus was a king of Sparta, and so Oebalia
is used z Laconia, but here, as the mention of the Galesus, a
river of Calabria, shows, = Tarentum which was founded by
Phalanthus, a Spartan (cf. Hor. Od. 2. 6. 12 seq., where he
also refers to the great charin and richness of the district).

126. niger] In artistic contrast with flarenlia; but the
Galesus is actually deep and dark.

127. Corycium] Corycus was a city in Cilicia with a famous
cave (Κωρύκιον ἄντρον) in the mountains close to it. Servius
says that the old man was one of the Cilicians settled in
Calabria by Pompey after his defeat of the Cilician pirates
(3.0. 67); in any case the Cilicians were expert gardeners,
growing saffron under glass‚ Mart. 8. 14. relicti: ‘aban-
doned' or ‘not appropriated' (cf. Cic. Agr. 1. 1 hanc silvam
in relictis possessionibus, aaz z'n censorum pascuis invenistis .?) as
what follows shows. It was neither good corn land (fertilis
iuvencis) nor pasturc land (nee pecori o. 3.) nor fit for vines
(nec c. Β.), and yet (lamen 130) this old man’s skill worked
wonders on it.

128. ina] emphatic, drawing marked attention to the poor-
ness of the laud. iuvencis : clearly dat. like pecori and
Baccho ; it yielded nothing to the steers which ploughed it.

129. seges] of the ‘land ’, ‘ soil ², itself.

130. rarum in dumis] ‘ here and there amid the bushes ' ;
an exaggerated expression, as though there were only a few
patchcs of soil among the thorns, etc.‚ which grew rank all
over.
