au article of luxury, cf. Ps. xlv. 8 σμύρνα καὶ στακία καὶ κασία
ἀπὸ τῶν ἱματίων σονς Job xlii. 14, ‘Kezia'.

31. graviter spirantis] ‘strong—smelling ’; for spirantis
metapliorically of scent cf. 417.

33-50. The laires· should have small entrances as a protection
aslainst heat aud colel. Bee-s* snfferfiom both, and consequently
themselves stop up every creoice with pmpolis aud was: (assor
tlte same reason they sometimes hire madeo-ground or in a hollow
tree), bnt you too must help them by plasteriny over the hive with
wind ancl leaves. No yews must be planted near them, nor crab-

shells δυνηθῶ ,· marslzy 9round, the smell of mud, and echoes
are disliked by them.

33. ipsa] Emphatie : the hives ‘ themselves ’ as opposed to
their surroundings. corticibus: ‘the bark of the eork tree
was called cortex by way of eminence ², Martyn. Columella
recommends it as ‘ warin in winter and eool in summer ³, cork

alvus for a hive in cases where the gender makes alveus im-

39. fuco et floribus] ‘with gum' οι· ‘paste from flowers’3
hendiadys, ef. 99 n. The substance referred to is certainly
not pollen, as Conington and others take it, for (Usucus is
not a powder, but either a (lye or something which can be

parison with 160 Narcissi lacrimam et lentum cle cortice alutem,
where this substance is. described as ‘the tears of the Nar-
cissus and sticky gum from bark', it is clear that Virgil
