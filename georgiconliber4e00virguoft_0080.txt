50 VERG. GEORG. IV.

217. attonunt umeris] Aristotle (H. A. 9. 40) says that
this is done ‘when he cannot fly', Pliny when he is ‘weary,'
and so too Varro. Cerda refers to Roman soldiers taking up
a eognmanger on the shields, and proclaiming him emperor,
see ἀεὶ. tho. c. 6.

218. pulchramque .. .] ‘ and seek through wounds a. glorious
death'3 the blows rain upon them as they rush on, and so
they are said to rush per vulnera.

219-227. From theee gissus some assere chat bees exhibit the
poemenion of that (livine imelliqence and etherea] principle
which, they say, animales and per-vades the universe, each
individrml life beina derived from it and αι death noc dying] but
returninq to ic into heaven.

Τ116 aether, according to many ancient pffilosophers, was
a subtle and fiery element which, as being lighter than

‘ The cumbrous elemente, earth, flood, air, fire’,

rises above them all, and so surrounds the universe and feeds
the heavenly bodies. It 13 regarded as the source of life
throughout the universe (and so it is ⁶ the soul of the universe’
anima mnndi, cf. line 221), and the individual life is derived
from it (line 224) and goes back to it (line 225), while in its
fune-st development it creates not only sense but intelligence
(menn in Stoic Ianguage πνεῦμα νοερὸν καὶ πυρῶδες). See
G. 1. 4153 Aen. 6. 724 seq. ; Milton, P. L. 3. 715-723.
Apparently Virgil means that the intelligence of bees is
quoted as an indication that this divine and intelliqent force
is to be found elsewhere than in mankind, and so may be
inserted to permeate all things.

220. partem divinae mentis] So Horace, S. 2. 2. 79 calls
the human sou] divinae particulam aurae. haustus aetherios:
‘draughts οἱ ether'; the way in which they receive the
ethereal 63361166 is expressed by the image of ‘drinking' it.
By a similar image in Gen. ii. 7, life is communicated to man
by being ‘breathed into his nostrils ’.

221. deum ...] ‘for that the Deity pervades all earth and
the expanse of sea and the heights of heaven; and thence
(i.e. from this pervading spirit) flocks , each creature at birth
derives the subtle 63361166 of life, yea and thither all things
are thereafter restored and return ‘.
