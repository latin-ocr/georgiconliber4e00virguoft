remember co fzcmz'yate them and to cuc out empty combs which
shelter insect3; (and clo not be too cimorous about taking] the
honey, sor) the 'more you take from them tlte more eaqerly wilc
they endeavour to make up tlte loss.

239. duram hiemem] ‘the cruel winter', against which, if
you take the honey‚ they will, you feel, be without protection,
so that you ‘ are tendet· to their future '.

241. suffire thymo] i. e. sor purification and to get rid of vermin.

243. stellio et] Spondeo, i being treated as consonantal,
cf. 38 n. et lucifugis : ⁴ and chambers full of skulking
beetles (have consumed the combs) '. The whole phrase
(zswarms of beetles) being parallel to stellio and fucus 244,
and forming part of the subject of adedit. Others supply sunt
after conqesta, but this is very awkward, as the words then
interrupt the construction of adedit stellio, which is resumed
in line 244. If the phrase lucifusyis ...blateis cannot be tolerated
as a nominative, then it is best to put a semicolon after blattis
and remove the one after fiacus.

contribute his share, and such ‘club' (linners were common

performing his munus of labour'.

246. invisa Minervae...] ‘ hateful to Minerva' as the goddess
of industry, whereas the spider’s web symbolizes domestic

described as a Lydian inaiden who irritated Minerva by the
beauty of her weaving and was changed into a spider.

248. acrius] exactly- - ‘more eagerly’, · acer: French afigyre
