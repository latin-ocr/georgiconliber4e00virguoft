70 V KRG. GEORG. IV.

415. ambrosiae odorem] Ambrosia is (1) the foocl of ‘ the
immortals’, from ἄμβροτος, and (2) a (livine unguent. The
word in this second sense (as here, and Aen. l. 403 ambrosiae-
que comae divinum vertice odorem Ι spiravere) being derived
from the Oriental ambar, the name of the perfume ambergris.
This unguent is non only sweetly-seented (417) but strength-
giving (418, cf. Aen. 12. 418 salubres l ambrosiae sucos et
odoriferam panaceam).

417. aura] ‘scent'; ef. Lucr. 2. 851 nullam quae mittit
naribus a'aram; Mart. 3. 65. 2 de Corycio quae venie aura
croco.

418. habilis] ‘ supple ’ (Kennedy).

419. exesi] ‘eaten out’, ‘hollowed’‚ i.e. by the action of
the water. quo plurima ε ‘whither full many a wave is
driven by the wind and separates itself into the rebiring bays ἐ
the great wave is broken up into small bodies of water which
creep up genbly into each little curve.

421. olim] ‘from time to time ’. Olim, from ille = olle, ‘ at
that time ’, ‘ nob ab this particular time ², has several meanings,
(1) ‘in time past’, ‘of old’; ef. Aen. 8. 348 aurea nunc, olim
silvestribus horrida dumis ; (2) ‘ in time to come ², ⁶ hereafter '';
ef. Aen. 1. 203 forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit3 (3)
‘often'‚ ‘at times’, of things which happen commonly, as
here and 423, cf. cum olim G. 2. 403; 3. 303. deprensis:
‘ caught: (by storm) ⁷3 so Hor. Od. 2. 16. 2 uses prensus in the
same sense absolutely—otium divos royac in patenti Ι prensus
Aeyaeo.

424. procul] ‘hard by ', ‘ close by’; ef. Ecl. 6. 16 serta
procul carmem capia· delapsa iacebam where the garlands
‘ jusb fallen from the head ' of the tipsy Silenus ‘lie close by
him ’. resistit : ‘withdraws into a veil of cloud '‚ the regular
method adopted by deities in Homer for concealing them-
selves or their friends. Curiously enough Virgil uses the
same verb to express the figure of Aeneas as he emerges from
a similar cloud ‘ standing ou‘c’ against the dark background,
see Aen. 1. 588 restitit Aeneas claraque in luce refidsit.

425. rapidus torrens] ‘that fiercely scorches '; for rapidus
of ‘eonsuming' beat cf. Ecl. 2. 10 rapido fessis messoribus
aestu.
