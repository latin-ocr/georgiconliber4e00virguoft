INTRODUOTION.

P. VERGILIUsl MARo was born Oct„ 15, Be. 70, at
Andes, a small village near Mantua in Cisalpine
Gaul, five years before Horace and seven before O.
Octavius, who later, under the names of Octavian
and Augustus, was destined to become his great
patron. His father was a yeoman, and cultivated
a small farm of his own. The boy was educated at
Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and is said to
have subsequently studied at Neapolis (Naples)
under Parthenius of Bithynia, from whom he learnt
Greek, and at Rome under Siron, an Epicurean
philosopher, and Epidius, a rhetorician. His works
afford ample evidence of his wide reading, and he
certainly merits the epithet of doctus to which all
the poets of his age aspired32 a noble passage in the
Georgies (2. 475-492> expresses his deep admiration

¹ The spelling Viryilius is wrong, but as an English word it
seems pedantic to alter ‘ Virgil’ established as it is by a long
literary tradition.
