NOTES. 27

floribus here, as yluten lentius is to lentum 9Zute7z ; (3) the actual
substance thus used by bees is propolis, a glutinons substance
‘ employed in fixiug the less adhesive wax to the roof of the
hive, and in stopping up any crevices ⁵, which Huber has seen
them collecting from a sort of varnish which exudes from the
buds of the white poplar. Pollen, on the other hand, is a
sort of dust collected from the anthers of flowers and stored
up, as ‘ bee-bread ², for feeding the young larvae.

oraS, ‘ edges ’, probably of the ‘ crevices,’ spu-amenta.

40. haec...] ‘for this very purpose ³, viz. of stopping up
chinks. This shows that ¹‹sl'zcten is the same thing as sucus et
floreS, being used for the same purpose.

41. pice Idae] Cf. G. 3. 450 Idaeasque pices.

42. effossis] Probably Virgil means ‘ excavated' by them-
selves: the humble-bee does actually so excavate its nest
underground.

43. fovere Larem] ‘ have kept their house warin ³ or ‘ snug ’.
Foveo is = ‘ keep warm '‚ especially by holding to the breast
or as birds keep their nest warm when sitting; cf. 56 pro-
qeniem nidosque-fovent, where the bees are said, like birds, to
‘keep warni their offspring and their nests'; G. 3. 420sovit
humum of a snake lying close in its hole; Aen. 9. 57 castra
fouere 3 1. 718 ῃγετηίο fovet ; 4. 686 sinu yermanamsovere, and
so to ‘fondle’‚ Ecl. 3. 4 Neaeram fovet ; Aen. 4. 193 fovere
iuter se. Then it is used of warm medical applications—
fomenta, ‘ poultices ⁵, and so of any application to the surface
of anything, cf. 46 unque soz-eng, ‘ anoint to keep them warni ⁷ ;
230 orafovc, G. 2. 135 orascrenff, ‘rinse’.

44. antro] i.e. which is ‘ a eave’ to them.

45. tu] Strong didactic emphasis, cf. 62, 106. tamen: i.e.
attilltgilpugh they do so much for themselves, ‘nevertheless do

47. taxum] The yew was considered poisonous (taxi 710-
centes, G. 2. 257), and specially injurious to bees, cf. Ecl. 9. 30
sic tua Cyrneas-suslz'mt examina taxos. neve z bees have a
strong dislike to some smells. Kennedy says that ‘burnt
crabs were used as a specific manure for certain trees ’.

48. altae...] ‘and put uo trust in a deep marsh, 01· (in a

place) where ' ; apparently both places are bad for the same
reason, viz. the smell.
