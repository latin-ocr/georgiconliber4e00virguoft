septima: ‘more than the seventh'; for quam omitted, cf.

busy and work abundant do not live for more than six or
seven weeks, as has been shown by the introduction of a
Ligurian queen into a hive of common black bees.

209. stat fortuna domus] The motto of Harrow. stat: the
simple sto is used in preference to any of its compounds to
express immovable fixity: the smallness of the word is its
strength; cf. Hor. Od. 3. 3. 42 stet Capitolium. fortuna:
a clear reference to the fortuna populi Romam'3 cf. Plut.
deforcmza Romanorum c. 4; Hor. Od. I. 35. The ‘ fortune’
of the commonwealth of bees is as steadfast as that of Rome.

pidity (cf. G. 2. 80 nec lonyum tempus, et thulen-&lexin ad caelum
ramisfelicilms arbos); the moment he is lost they destroy every-
thing. On the loss of a queen, according to Figuier, the
bees ⁶ without losing time in useless regrets, apply themselves
to repair their loss' which they do by selecting a larva, and
feeding it on ‘royal’ food; others, however, speak of there
being great confusion for some days.
